What response did you receive from the server after posting? I have also noticed that your selenium-whatsapp-script.py is not portable and therefore I cannot run it on another machine without the code breaking down. As tasks for this week, take the following steps to make it portable: (1) create a project folder into which to keep all project resources including the script. (2) Make sure both the python virtual environment into which the script runs and the chrome executable for selenium reside in the project directory. You may need to use portable chrome. (3) Make sure any links in the script are relative. (4) Test to be sure the script can run on a different machine. (5) Share the project folder with me, probably on GitHub.",4.780645161290322
